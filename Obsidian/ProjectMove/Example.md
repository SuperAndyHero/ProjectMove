Hello world! Obsidian uses markdown formatting with a clean text editor.
**This is some bold text.**
*This is italics*, ~~this is strikethrough~~ 

This is a new paragraph.

```cs
using System.Console;
public class Program {
	void MyMethod(){
		int myInt = 10;
		Console.WriteLine("It even supports code markdown!");
	}
}
```
